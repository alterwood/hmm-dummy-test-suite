/*
 * Framework for creating test case and stress test for HMM through the dummy
 * kernel driver. Each test should have one function name hmm_test() taking a
 * pointer to hmm_ctx struct as unique parameter and returning a pointer to an
 * hmm_test_result struct.
 *
 * HMM stands for Heterogeneous Memory Management, it is an helper layer inside
 * the linux kernel to help device driver mirror a process address space on to
 * the device. This allow device's thread to use the same address space which
 * makes communication and data exchange with CPU thread a lot easier.
 *
 * This framework sole purpose is to exercise various code path inside kernel
 * to make sure that HMM performs as expected and also to flush out any bugs.
